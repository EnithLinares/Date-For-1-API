# Date for 1 - Server Repo

For the client repo please visit [this repo](https://github.com/EnithLinares/Date-For-1/blob/main/README.md)

## Overview

"Date for 1" is an app designed to help people explore their cities and plan solo dates. The app suggests activities based on the time of day, the user's desired experience, and their current mood.
It aims to provide personalized recommendations for solo outings, encouraging users to enjoy their own company while discovering new experiences in their city.

### Problem Space

There is currently no centralized space for people to easily find and plan activities in their city, particularly for solo outings. This gap is especially noticeable for cultural activities such as attending plays, creating art, or visiting galleries, which are often not widely advertised, while emphasizing local venues and third spaces.

Many individuals feel pressure to engage in interesting activities only when with others, as planning for oneself can seem like too much effort. "Date for 1" aims to address these issues by:

-   Providing a centralized platform for discovering solo activities in one's city.
-   Focusing on cultural and lesser-known experiences that may be overlooked.
-   Simplifying the planning process for solo outings, reducing the perceived effort.
-   Encouraging self-exploration and personal growth through solo experiences.

### User Profile

The primary users of "Date for 1" are individuals with the following characteristics:

-   Age Range: 16-40 years old.
-   Personality: Introverted, self-reflective, likes exploring new places, tries to include new activities to change the daily routine.
-   Interests: Culturally aware, appreciative of local experiences, enjoying ‘me time’.
-   Preferences:
    -   Enjoy exploring local spaces such as restaurants, shops, and museums
    -   Keen to discover new aspects of their city
    -   Value quality "me time" and personal enrichment

These users are likely to be:

-   Comfortable with technology and mobile apps
-   Seeking ways to make solo outings more enjoyable and less daunting
-   Interested in personal growth and self-discovery through experiences
-   Looking for curated suggestions that align with their interests and mood

### Features

-   Mood-based Search: Users can search for activities by selecting their current mood from a predefined list.
-   Add an Activity: Users can contribute to the app's database by adding their own activities. They will complete a form with details including:
    -   Activity description
    -   Location
    -   Cost
    -   Preferred time of day
    -   Suitable mood
    -   Image for activity preview
        For the MVP, this function will be demo by the developer and will not require a user login

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

For the "Date for 1" app, we will be using the following technologies:

-   Frontend:
    React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
    React Router DOM: For handling routing in the React application
    Sass: A CSS preprocessor for more maintainable and feature-rich stylesheets
    React-Toastify: For displaying notifications to users
    Vite: A build tool that provides faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects
    React-multi-carousel: To handle a carousel of activity images

-   Backend:
    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code
    Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
    Knex.js: A SQL query builder for Node.js, which will help with database operations
    MySQL: Our chosen relational database management system
    Multer middleware: For handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files
    CORS middleware: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing our frontend to communicate with the backend API

-   Development Tools:
    npm: The package manager for JavaScript, used to manage project dependencies
    Figma: For designing and prototyping the user interface

Potential Limitations: - React.js: While powerful, React has a steep learning curve and may require more setup time compared to simpler frameworks. - JavaScript: As a single-threaded language, JavaScript may face performance issues with complex calculations or large data sets. - MySQL: While reliable, MySQL might face scalability issues with very large datasets compared to NoSQL alternatives. - Sass: While Sass offers many features, it requires compilation, which can add complexity to the build process. - Node.js: Being single-threaded, Node.js may not be ideal for CPU-intensive tasks.

### APIs

For the "Date for 1" app, we will be developing our own custom API to handle the core functionality of the application. This API will be responsible for:

-   Managing activity data (CRUD operations)
-   Processing activity recommendations based on user input
-   Storing and retrieving venue information

Key endpoints of our custom API will include:

-   /api/activities: For retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting activities
-   /api/recommendations: For generating personalized activity recommendations
